    # The 2011 NETSSYS data is actually for 2012, based on the NETSSYS 2011 report, but including things slated for construction in 2011 and 2012. That includes mostly wind. NB also that no embedded generation is included so the totals for wind are lower than in reality, but that should be fine for our purposes.
